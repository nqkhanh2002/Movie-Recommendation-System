# EDSA-Movie_Recommender-Streamlit-App

In today's technology driven world, recommender systems are socially and economically critical for ensuring that individuals can make appropriate choices surrounding the content they engage with on a daily basis.
One application where this is especially true surrounds movie content recommendations; where intelligent algorithms can help viewers find great titles from tens of thousands of options.

As part of the requirements for closing out the Unspervised learning Sprint at ExploreAI, My team was tasked to build a movie recommendation algorithm 
based on content or collaborative filtering, capable of accurately predicting how a user will rate a movie they have not yet viewed based on their historical preferences.

The objective of this project is to provide an accurate and robust solution that has immense economic potential, with users of the system being exposed to content they would like to view or purchase - generating revenue and platform affinity.
